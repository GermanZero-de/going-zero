What is this?
================

Our original facts and assumptions spreadsheet contained lots of numbers that were derived from other facts / assumptions.
This is of course undesirable as it makes it difficult to ensure that the numbers are consistent.

So before our big data update we decided to write a script to calculate all the derived numbers from the original facts and
assumptions spreadsheet.

For that Hauke (our Quantitive Researcher in Residence) wrote a annotated version of the original spreadsheet in which he
added the formulas that were used to calculate the derived numbers.

This script takes the annotated spreadsheet and output a python module that can compute the derived facts.
