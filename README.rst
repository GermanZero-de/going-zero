Localzero Generator Core
=========================
LocalZero is a community project providing a tool that can not only determine green house gas budgets but also final energy consumptions per sector
for a given city/district and target year. In addition, the tool informs costs and the most important measures required to become carbon neutral.

More information on the methodology can be found in our documentation on readthedocs.

- 19.03.2018 Important Note!
    - The LocalZero Generator is not yet usable, as some required data is proprietary. However, the tool can be tested on our website: germanzero.de/loesungen/localzero. Future work will include the development of a REST API Service.


Setup
=========================
- Install Python
    - Version 3.10.
- Install Git
		- ensure that git is in your PATH variable (needed for devtool.py data checkout later)
- Install Poetry from https://python-poetry.org/docs/
    - **On Windows:** run this inside a power shell:

      :code:`(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python`

- Configure Git
	- Token:
		- https://github.com/settings/tokens:
		- create personal access token (repo, workflow, admin:org:read, gist)
		- save your token
		- On Windows Token add the token Windows Anmeldeinformationen (similar tools exist on linux and mac)
			- Generische Anmeldeinformationen hinzuf√ºgen (Adresse: git:https://github.com, Benutzername: Git Nutzername, Passwort: Token)
    - get this Git Repo (if you haven't done so already)
	- :code:`git clone https://github.com/GermanZero-de/localzero-generator-core`

- Install poetry and pre-commit
	- :code:`install-environment.sh`
	- **On Windows:** install Node.js (necessary for pyright)

- Get the required Data Repos
    - Clone https://github.com/GermanZero-de/localzero-data-public into ./data/public
    - Clone https://github.com/GermanZero-de/localzero-data-proprietary into ./data/proprietary

      **ISSUE:** You might not have access to the proprietary repository. We are providing a REST API Service soon.

Development
-----
This repository contains the calculations of the LocalZero Generator Core only. It should neither contain reference data
nor anything that is specific to the website.

For local development, checkout our helpful commands in devtool.py please.


Formatting
-----
We use **black** to automatically format the code and thereby avoid any spurious merge
conflicts, due to layout differences. This will happen in a pre-commit automatically,
but to for the best experience you should configure your editor to do the same.


Testing
-------

We use :code:`pytest` (the tests are in the directory `tests`).  We used to run a lot of
tests automatically in github actions, but sadly it turned out that they easily used more
than 2000 minutes every month (mostly because of the overhead involved in recreating
the local development environment inside github).

So now we rely on a little discipline enforced by peer pressure. When you make changes
you should run :code:`python devtool.py ready-to-rock` before you push.  And you are only ready to push
if it outputs: :code:`I'm ready to rock and save the climate`. Please include the output
of the tool in your feature description like this:
